# TAMU-Datathon-2023
*Welcome to the TAMU Datathon 2023 GitHub repository for Team: 45.*

## Overview
*This repository contains all the resources, code, and data for our team's participation in the TAMU Datathon for 2023.
Our project is training an ai model using a dataset to determine the accuracy of a patient surviving given
the specifics of their condition.*

**Debrief**
- The dataset given to us is in the form of a csv file, the first row having the titles of the columns,
  and each subsequent row will containing information for a patient given by the hospital with one row
  representing one patient.
- Provided with a dataset with inherent flaws, we had to adjust, scrape through, and clean up the data.
- Afterwards, we used recursive feature elimination to find what features contributed most to survival.
- This allowed us to train the Keras Sequential Model to predict data.
- The predictions from this model were submitted to get a score on how accurate it was.
